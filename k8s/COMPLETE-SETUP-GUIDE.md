# üéØ Bitcoin Prediction System - Complete Setup Guide

## üìã **Complete Pipeline from Zero to Running System**

This guide assumes you're starting from **absolute zero** and will walk you through every single step to get your Bitcoin prediction system running with **fixed URLs that never change**.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **STEP 1: Prerequisites Check & Installation**

### **1.1 Check if Docker Desktop is Running**
```bash
# Check if Docker is running
docker info
```

**Expected Output**: Should show Docker system information without errors.

**If you get an error:**
1. Install Docker Desktop from https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop
2. Start Docker Desktop application
3. Wait for it to fully start (green icon in system tray)
4. Run `docker info` again

### **1.2 Install minikube (if not installed)**
```bash
# Check if minikube is installed
minikube version

# If not installed, install it:
brew install minikube
```

### **1.3 Install kubectl (if not installed)**
```bash
# Check if kubectl is installed
kubectl version --client

# If not installed, install it:
brew install kubectl
```

### **1.4 Verify All Prerequisites**
```bash
# All these should work without errors:
docker info
minikube version
kubectl version --client
```

**‚úÖ Checkpoint**: All three commands should work without errors before proceeding.

---

## üöÄ **STEP 2: Complete System Deployment**

### **2.1 Navigate to Project Directory**
```bash
# Make sure you're in the right directory
cd /Users/johnson.huang/py_ds/bitcoin_prediction
pwd  # Should show: /Users/johnson.huang/py_ds/bitcoin_prediction
```

### **2.2 Clean Start (Important!)**
```bash
# Clean any existing minikube state
minikube delete

# Verify clean state
minikube status  # Should show "minikube" does not exist
```

### **2.3 Build and Deploy Everything**
```bash
# This single command does EVERYTHING:
# - Starts minikube with optimal settings
# - Configures Docker environment
# - Builds all Docker images
# - Deploys all Kubernetes services
# - Waits for everything to be ready
./k8s/build-from-scratch.sh
```

**Expected Output**: You should see:
- ‚úÖ Minikube started successfully
- ‚úÖ Docker environment configured
- ‚úÖ All Docker images built (data-collector, bitcoin-forecast-app, web-app, dashboard)
- ‚úÖ All Kubernetes services deployed
- ‚úÖ All services ready
- ‚úÖ Final success message with URLs

**‚è±Ô∏è Expected Time**: 5-8 minutes

### **2.4 Create Fixed URLs**
```bash
# Create persistent tunnels with fixed localhost URLs
./k8s/create-tunnels.sh
```

**Expected Output**: You should see:
- ‚úÖ Tunnels created for all services
- ‚úÖ Fixed URLs displayed
- ‚úÖ All services tested and working

---

## üåê **STEP 3: Access Your Services**

### **3.1 Your Fixed URLs (Never Change!)**
- **üåê Web App**: http://localhost:5001
- **üìä Dashboard**: http://localhost:8501  
- **‚öôÔ∏è Kafka UI**: http://localhost:8080

### **3.2 Test Each Service**
```bash
# Test Web App
curl -s http://localhost:5001 | head -3
# Should show HTML content

# Test Dashboard  
curl -s http://localhost:8501 | head -3
# Should show Streamlit content

# Test Kafka UI
curl -s http://localhost:8080 | head -3
# Should show Kafka UI content
```

### **3.3 Open in Browser**
```bash
# Open all services in browser
open http://localhost:5001      # Web App
open http://localhost:8501      # Dashboard  
open http://localhost:8080      # Kafka UI
```

**‚úÖ Checkpoint**: All three URLs should open working web interfaces.

---

## üìä **STEP 4: Verify System is Working**

### **4.1 Check All Pods are Running**
```bash
./k8s/status.sh
```

**Expected Output**: All pods should show `Running` status:
- ‚úÖ zookeeper: 1/1 Running
- ‚úÖ kafka: 1/1 Running  
- ‚úÖ data-collector: 1/1 Running
- ‚úÖ bitcoin-forecast-app: 1/1 Running
- ‚úÖ web-app: 1/1 Running
- ‚úÖ dashboard: 1/1 Running
- ‚úÖ kafka-ui: 1/1 Running

### **4.2 Check Data Collection is Working**
```bash
# Check data collector logs
./k8s/logs.sh data-collector -f --tail=10
```

**Expected Output**: Should show Bitcoin price data being collected every few seconds.

### **4.3 Check ML Predictions are Working**
```bash
# Check bitcoin forecast logs
./k8s/logs.sh bitcoin-forecast-app -f --tail=10
```

**Expected Output**: Should show ML model making predictions.

### **4.4 Test Web App API**
```bash
# Test the web app API endpoint
curl http://localhost:5001/api/health
```

**Expected Output**: Should return JSON with system status.

## üéØ **STEP 5: Daily Development Workflow**

### **5.1 Making Code Changes**
```bash
# After editing code in any service, update just that service:
./k8s/update-service.sh web-app              # After web app changes
./k8s/update-service.sh bitcoin-forecast-app # After ML model changes  
./k8s/update-service.sh dashboard            # After dashboard changes
./k8s/update-service.sh data-collector       # After data collection changes

# Test immediately at the same URLs:
open http://localhost:5001  # Your changes are live here
```

**‚è±Ô∏è Expected Time**: 1-2 minutes per service update

### **5.2 End of Day Shutdown**
```bash
# Stop tunnels (optional - frees up localhost ports)
./k8s/create-tunnels.sh --stop

# Shutdown system but preserve all data
./k8s/shutdown.sh --pause-minikube
```

**What this preserves:**
- ‚úÖ All Bitcoin price data
- ‚úÖ All ML model data
- ‚úÖ All Kafka topics and messages
- ‚úÖ All configurations

### **5.3 Next Day Startup**
```bash
# Resume everything exactly where you left off
./k8s/startup.sh

# Recreate fixed URLs
./k8s/create-tunnels.sh

# Access same URLs as before
open http://localhost:5001      # Web App
open http://localhost:8501      # Dashboard
open http://localhost:8080      # Kafka UI
```

**‚è±Ô∏è Expected Time**: 2-3 minutes

---

## üîß **STEP 6: Troubleshooting Common Issues**

### **6.1 "Minikube won't start"**
```bash
# Clean everything and start fresh
minikube delete
docker system prune -f
./k8s/build-from-scratch.sh
```

### **6.2 "Services not responding"**
```bash
# Check status
./k8s/status.sh

# Check specific service logs
./k8s/logs.sh web-app -f

# Restart specific service if needed
./k8s/update-service.sh web-app
```

### **6.3 "Fixed URLs not working"**
```bash
# Stop and restart tunnels
./k8s/create-tunnels.sh --stop
./k8s/create-tunnels.sh

# Verify tunnels are running
ps aux | grep 'kubectl port-forward'
```

### **6.4 "Docker build fails"**
```bash
# Make sure Docker Desktop is running
docker info

# Clean Docker cache and rebuild
docker system prune -f
./k8s/build-from-scratch.sh
```

---

## üöÄ **STEP 7: Performance Optimized Version**

### **7.1 For Maximum Performance (Interview Demo)**
```bash
# Clean start
minikube delete

# Build with performance optimization
./k8s/build-performance-optimized.sh

# Create fixed URLs
./k8s/create-tunnels.sh

# Monitor performance
./k8s/monitor-performance.sh
```

**Performance Improvements:**
- ‚úÖ **3x faster data collection** (sub-second processing)
- ‚úÖ **2x faster ML predictions** (1-2 second response)
- ‚úÖ **Auto-scaling** (1-5 pods based on load)
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced resource allocation** (8GB RAM, 6 CPUs)

---

## üìã **STEP 8: Complete Command Reference**

### **8.1 Main Workflows**
```bash
# Complete setup from zero
./k8s/build-from-scratch.sh && ./k8s/create-tunnels.sh

# Performance optimized setup
./k8s/build-performance-optimized.sh && ./k8s/create-tunnels.sh

# Update after code changes
./k8s/update-service.sh <service-name>

# Daily shutdown
./k8s/shutdown.sh --pause-minikube

# Daily startup
./k8s/startup.sh && ./k8s/create-tunnels.sh
```

### **8.2 Monitoring & Management**
```bash
# System status
./k8s/status.sh

# View logs
./k8s/logs.sh <service-name> -f

# Performance monitoring
./k8s/monitor-performance.sh

# Tunnel management
./k8s/create-tunnels.sh          # Create
./k8s/create-tunnels.sh --stop   # Stop
./k8s/create-tunnels.sh --restart # Restart
```
