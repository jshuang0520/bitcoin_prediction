## Project Overview

The Bitcoin Price Forecasting system provides real-time predictions of cryptocurrency prices with uncertainty bounds. The system continuously ingests market data, processes it through a TensorFlow Probability model, and generates forecasts that are displayed through an interactive dashboard.

Key features include:
- Real-time price monitoring and forecasting
- Uncertainty quantification with confidence intervals
- Anomaly detection for unusual price movements
- Interactive visualization through a web dashboard

## Architecture

The system consists of several interconnected components:

1. **Data Collector**: Streams real-time Bitcoin price data from exchanges
2. **Bitcoin Forecast App**: Core forecasting engine using TensorFlow Probability
3. **Web Dashboard**: Interactive frontend for visualizing predictions and metrics
4. **Kafka Infrastructure**: Message broker for component communication

The components are containerized using Docker and orchestrated with Docker Compose for easy deployment and scaling.

## Implementation Details

### Data Pipeline

The data pipeline processes Bitcoin price data through several stages:

1. **Collection**: Raw price data is collected from cryptocurrency exchanges
2. **Preprocessing**: Data is cleaned, normalized, and checked for anomalies
3. **Feature Engineering**: Technical indicators are calculated to enhance prediction
4. **Model Input**: Processed data is fed into the forecasting model

### Model Structure

The forecasting model uses a structural time series approach with these components:

1. **Local Linear Trend**: Captures the primary price movement direction
2. **Seasonal Components**: Models daily and weekly trading patterns
3. **Autoregressive Components**: Captures short-term dependencies
4. **Volatility Modeling**: Special handling for cryptocurrency volatility

The model is implemented using TensorFlow Probability's `tfp.sts` module, which provides a flexible framework for Bayesian time series modeling.

### Forecasting Process

The forecasting process follows these steps:

1. **Model Initialization**: Parameters are set based on configuration
2. **Training**: Model is fitted to historical data using variational inference
3. **Prediction**: Forecasts are generated with uncertainty intervals
4. **Evaluation**: Predictions are compared to actual prices
5. **Continuous Learning**: Model is updated with new observations

## Results and Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using several metrics:

1. **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Measures average prediction error
2. **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)**: Emphasizes larger errors
3. **Uncertainty Calibration**: Assesses if confidence intervals are well-calibrated
4. **Anomaly Detection Rate**: Measures effectiveness of anomaly detection

The system achieves competitive forecast accuracy while providing meaningful uncertainty estimates that help users understand prediction confidence.
