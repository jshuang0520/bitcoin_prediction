"""
TensorFlow Probability model for Bitcoin price forecasting.

1. This module implements a structural time series model specifically optimized for
   cryptocurrency price forecasting with the following key components:
   - Local linear trend for capturing price movements
   - Seasonal components for daily and weekly patterns
   - Autoregressive components for short-term dynamics
   - Specialized components for cryptocurrency volatility

2. The implementation follows best practices in Bayesian time series modeling with:
   - Proper prior specification for cryptocurrency data
   - Multiple optimization approaches (VI and MCMC)
   - Robust uncertainty quantification
   - Ensemble prediction methods
